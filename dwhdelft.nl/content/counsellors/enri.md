  nl: |
    I am a member of DWH since I was I was 18, right before corona. Since then, I made a lot of friends in Outsite
    and I am still an active volunteer. At the same time, I am also busy with my study (Nanobiology) and with my
    handball team. Aside from that, I like to travel, organise fun activities, going to movies, explore cafes in
    Delft... I keep myself busy but I always prioritise lending a helping hand to a friend or to anyone who needs
    someone to talk to :)
