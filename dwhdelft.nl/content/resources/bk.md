## Purple Pit Stop
The Faculty of Architecture is organising a "Pimp Yourself Purple Pitstop" at the Service Point in the central hall. Students and staff can all get dressed up in purple with clothes, accessories and purple nail polish. Posters are also available. This available to all initiative is a repetition of last year's success!
