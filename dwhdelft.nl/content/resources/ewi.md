## Lunch lecture
There will be a lunch lecture about queer life, what it means to be queer in the university, and how we can work towards a better world.

## Study Associations
At the Elektrotechnische Vereeniging (ETV), the D&I committee is active in the boardroom with low-key activities such as nail painting and interactive moments, with a special focus on conversations about diversity and inclusion. W.I.S.V. ‘Christiaan Huygens’ (CH) is also participating with similar initiatives. Both associations will be present in the main hall to hand out flyers and create awareness.
