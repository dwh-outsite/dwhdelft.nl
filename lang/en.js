    text: `Outsite is the part of DWH (Delftse Werkgroep Homoseksualiteit) specially for LGBT+ youth. We are there for
      everybody who identifies as such. As a society we organise all kinds of activities, ranging from drinks every
      Thursday night and quarterly LGBT+ parties to trips to other cities where we go out together.<br>
      <br>
      These activities are all organized by our fantastic committees and members! The best way to become acquainted with
      Outsite would be to take party in the introduction groups (which we call KMGs) or through the use of the bar buddy
      system: Where we will make sure there is someone ready at the bar to show you around and who could introduce you
      to others.`

      get to know the society but also to become close to other LGBT+ youth, all under supervision of two experienced
      Outsite members. It is a chance to share your coming out stories in a close group and to visit queer parties
      amongst others.`

        about Outsite but they can also introduce you to new people.`
