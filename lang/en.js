      <br />
      <strong>Goal</strong><br />
      DWH is thé association by and for LGBT+ people in Delft that looks out for the LGBT+ community and their needs in
      this city and independently promotes the emancipation and awareness of LGBT+ people. DWH does this as much as
      possible in collaboration with other organisations at a local, national and international level.<br />
      <br />
      The vision of the association is as follows:<br />
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>DWH fights hetero normativity and promotes the acceptation and itegration of LGBT+ lifestyles;</li>
        <li>DWH stimulates societal discussion, awareness and change on issues of homosexuality, bisexuality and
            transgenders;</li>
        <li>DWH creates a friendly and safe environment as a basis for LGBT+ emancipation;</li>
        <li>DWH involves as many people as possible, inside and outside the association, with participation and
            organisation of its activities;</li>
        <li>DWH connects people. Specifically also the various subgroups in the association.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <strong>Recompense policy</strong><br />
      The board members as well as other volunteers at DWH are unpaid. The board does have the means to provide
      compensation to members and volunteers for costs they incurred because of the association, which is done in
      accordance with the budget and reasonable bounds of good faith and fair dealing as it is commonly done in broader
      society. In practice only expenses claims pertaining to tasks performed in service of DWH are compensated.
      By the statutes of DWH the consent of the general assembly is required for starting, changing or terminating
      employment contracts.

    main_text: `
      Who doesn’t remember puberty? A period with many changes… Hair begins to grow in places, you start being
      independent from your parents and you fall in love for the first time! But what if you fall in love with someone
      of the same gender?<br />
      <br />
      Many LGBT youngsters can’t cope with this and don’t dare to come out because they fear they might be victims of
      bullying. In high schools, the word gay is unfortunately too often used as a term of abuse. This shows that young
      people often don’t have a grasp of what constitutes homosexuality, which sometimes can result in incomprehension
      and harassment.<br />
      <br />
      Through education we can show the young people that homosexuality is not that strange. By breaking stereotypes and
      explaining the sexual diversity terms, we get the youth to think actively about homosexuality and its meaning for
      themselves. Experience shows that after being informed, young people have more respect for sexual diversity and
      more importantly, for each other!<br />
      <br />
      DWH characterizes itself for having a predominantly young and enthusiastic team of educators. Through this small
      age difference with the high school students it is often easy for them to relate and identify to our educators.

      The contribution fee of DWH is a minimum of € 48,50 / € 25,00  per year. A higher amount is of course very
      welcome.<br />
      <br />
      In a general assembly meeting, it was decided that the price differentiation for the membership fee is based on
      the ability to pay. In order not to make it too complicated, we use the following rule of thumb: For people aged
      under 25 or from pension age, the reduced fee of at least € 25,00 is applied.
      All other members pay the standard fee of € 48,50.<br />
      <br />
      There are exceptions:
      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>People who would get the reduced rate but earn enough to pay for the standard rate, should pay the standard
            rate.</li>
        <li>People who would not get the reduced rate but can’t financially cope with paying the standard rate can
            contact the treasurer.</li>
        <li>When there is a change in the situation that would effect any of the above exceptions, it should be reported

      choose your seat at one of our tables for 2-4 persons (everybody will sit 1.5 metres apart). Are you
      visiting with somebody from your own household? Then we have several seats for two persons available,
      where you are allowed to stay within 1.5 metres of each other. You are also welcome without a booking,
      in that case we will make a booking for you <strong>on the spot</strong>.

      Upon entrance we ask you to desinfect your hands, afterwards you can choose the seat you would like to
      sit. At the barevening you will be served at your table, with this measure we want to prevent you from
      walking too much and crossing paths with other visitors. Aside from this, we ask you to not keep the
      aisles occupied when it's not necessary: you are not suppose to have conversations at other tables.

      On Remembrance Day we commemorate all victims of wars together. This year is different from other years. Maybe you
      visit, like many of us, the local commemoration of Remembrance Day with your family or friends every year. This
      year however, it’s not safe to physically be together. This is why we want to remember via this website all Dutch
      victims of World War II and military conflicts and peacekeeping missions after this. We ask you to commemorate
      together with us, by joining our virtual wreath-laying below.<br />
      <br />
      In particular we want to remember the oppression and persecution of LGBT+ people across the world, during and
      after the second World War. The war played a large role in it. Though few LGBT+ people in the Netherlands were
      directly persecuted, the first steps forward LGBT+ emancipation had made were unmade. The first transgender clinic
      of the world, in Berlin, was destroyed and its archives burned. The world would have to wait until the seventies
      for the second one.<br />
      <br />
      Remembering our history also spurs us on to stay vigilant. We are proud of all the progress made in this country,
      but we must remember that progress and emancipation are not a given. It can halt or relapse if our attention
      lapses.<br />
      <br />
      In this, we cannot be selfish. Our freedom to be who we are and love whom we love is, as history tells us,
      entwined with the rights of others to be themselves in their way. Freedom kept is freedom shared. The same goes in
      the current crisis: no single group can stop it, only shared responsibility can. Let us remember the past and the
      present, and not forget this lesson after this crisis either.
