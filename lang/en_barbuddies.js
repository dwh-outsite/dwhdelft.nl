  Daan: `
  Hey hey, I'm Daan. Twenty years old and currently doing my bachelor Electrical Engineering here in Delft. I have been
  visiting DWH/Outsite for just over a year now, but in this one year I have had tons of fun on the bar nights and other
  activities organized by the association. It can be difficult to get the courage to finally visit a bar like ours, and 
  I know this from experience. I hope that I can help you make this first step. As a barbuddy I would like to introduce
  you to all different kinds of people that visit our association on an evening. I can also tell you more about our
  activities, so that maybe one day we will see you again, this time without a barbuddy :)

  Jeff: `
  Hi, my name is Jeff. I'm in my late twenties, and I study Computer Science at TU Delft. I've been a member of Outsite
  for a few years now. I'm a regular at the EatingOUT on Tuesdays, but I'm happy to be your barbuddy on a Thursday. I
  remember how jittery I was walking into the bar for the first time, and that was for the introduction group. That
  turned out to be a great decision though, because DWH/Outsite is just a really nice place with lovely people and fun
  activities.

  Andreas: `
  Hey, I’m Andreas, in my early twenties and an Aerospace student. I am a very active member of DWH/Outsite and I love
  meeting new people and showing them our society. For me it is a place where you can be yourself and can participated
  in all sorts of fun activities.

  Pedro: `
  Hola! My name is Pedro and I am in my early twenties. I am currently studying Microelectronics at TU-Delft, but my
  real passion outside of university is cooking. Over the past year I have been very involved at DWH helping with events
  and volunteering as a bartender. I would be very happy to introduce you to the association and its amazing/fabulous
  members (and maybe I can share a couple of recipes or comment on the last RPDR episode while doing so). You won’t
  regret coming to DWH for a drink, a dance, or just a chat, and you will feel the love and support of our beautiful
  community.

  Niv: `
  Hey! I’m Niv, 21 yo and studying Applied Physics. In the meantime, I found my place in this cool association (I’m a
  KMG parent and I organise the OWee this year). When I first stepped foot into the building, I was so nervous! I soon
  met some really nice and special people, which I consider to be my close friends now. If you feel nervous about coming
  to DWH/Outsite, I totally get it; that’s how we all felt the first time. I hope I can make it easier for you!

  Wessel: `
  Heya! I'm Wessel, 24 years old and I study Aerospace engineering. When I joined Outsite by joining the KMG, the
  enthusiasm coming from the members and the open and loving atmosphere made me feel at home straight away! I also
  started helping with parties and other activities and by doing so I got to know the association well pretty quickly
  and saw the power in our diverse association, everybody chipping in with their talents which results in very awesome
  activities! For me Outsite feels as one big family where everybody has their own cozy place and I would love to help
  you find yours at Outsite!

  Hidde: `
  Hey, I am Hidde. I am 23 years old and studying for a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, the probability track.
  I first came to Outsite around 3 years ago, but it wasn’t until last year that I became a lot more active; I am often
  a volunteer during events, joined various committees and am now also a barbuddy. This is a huge difference with the
  first few years that I visited Outsite. I often sat alone and didn’t talk much with other people, since I didn’t
  really feel like I knew them. This is where a barbuddy comes in! As your barbuddy, I can introduce you to all kinds of
  people from Outsite, including myself of course, and make sure you get to know them and they get to know you. Then the
  next time you decide to visit, you won’t feel like you’re standing in between a group of strangers, but hopefully will
  see some nice, familiar faces.

  Matthew: `
  Heyyy I am Matthew, a Palestinian boy in his mid-twenties doing his masters in Microelectronics. When TU is not
  consuming my soul I enjoy reading (fiction and non-finction), exercising (regular gym goer, picking up running and
  bouldering), gaming (board and video games, obsessed with escape rooms), and TV Shows (random Netflix and Rupauls). I
  am happy you decided to come to Outsite, see you there!
