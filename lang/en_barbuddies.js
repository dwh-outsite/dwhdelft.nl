  Andreas: `
  Hey, I’m Andreas, in my mid twenties and an Aerospace student. I am a very active member of DWH and I love
  meeting new people and showing them our society. For me it is a place where you can be yourself and can participated
  in all sorts of fun activities.

  Jeff: `
  Hi, my name is Jeff. I'm in my late twenties, and I study Computer Science at TU Delft. I've been a member of DWH
  for a few years now. I'm a regular at the EatingOUT on Tuesdays, but I'm happy to be your barbuddy on a Thursday. I
  remember how jittery I was walking into the bar for the first time, and that was for the introduction group. That
  turned out to be a great decision though, because DWH is just a really nice place with lovely people and fun
  activities.

  Hello I’m Govert, at the start of my thirties. I study architecture and I’m a teacher a high school. I’m a very active
  volunteer within DWH. In my opinion, DWH stands for a niceand really diverse group of people. A place to organize lots
  of things and also a place to learn a lot about yourself. I really like meeting new people and introducing them to
  this awesome association.

  Niv: `
  Hey! I’m Niv, 22 yo and studying Applied Physics. In the meantime, I found my place in this cool association (I’m a
  KMG parent and I organise the OWee this year). When I first stepped foot into the building, I was so nervous! I soon
  met some really nice and special people, which I consider to be my close friends now. If you feel nervous about coming
  to DWH, I totally get it; that’s how we all felt the first time. I hope I can make it easier for you!

  Carlos: `
  Hey hola! I'm Carlos, a 24-year-old Spaniard, studying MSc Design for Interaction. I've been in DWH for a bit 
  over three years now, and have found not only good people; but also an amazing opportunity. An opportunity to 
  exchange experiences and enrich each other's lives, a way to get to know people outside your own bubble, your own 
  country, your own culture. Also bartending is just fun af. I can introduce you to the grooviest (do folks say that 
  anymore?) people; and have long (and fiery) debates about activism, art or music. Or basically any other thing. If 
  you're feeling isolated or insecure, I think coming to DWH and letting yourself be warmly welcomed is one of 
  the best things you can do.

  Wessel: `
  Heya! I'm Wessel, 24 years old and I study Aerospace engineering. When I joined DWH by joining the KMG, the
  enthusiasm coming from the members and the open and loving atmosphere made me feel at home straight away! I also
  started helping with parties and other activities and by doing so I got to know the association well pretty quickly
  and saw the power in our diverse association, everybody chipping in with their talents which results in very awesome
  activities! For me DWH feels as one big family where everybody has their own cozy place and I would love to 
  help you find yours at DWH!

  Hidde: `
  Hey, I am Hidde. I am 24 years old and studying for a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, the probability track.
  I first came to DWH around 3 years ago, but it wasn’t until last year that I became a lot more active; I am 
  often a volunteer during events, joined various committees and am now also a barbuddy. This is a huge difference with 
  the first few years that I visited DWH. I often sat alone and didn’t talk much with other people, since I
  didn’t really feel like I knew them. This is where a barbuddy comes in! As your barbuddy, I can introduce you to all 
  kinds of people from DWH, including myself of course, and make sure you get to know them and they get to know 
  you. Then the next time you decide to visit, you won’t feel like you’re standing in between a group of strangers, but 
  hopefully will see some nice, familiar faces.

  Heyyy I am Matthew, a Palestinian boy in his mid-twenties doing his masters in Microelectronics. When TU is not
  consuming my soul I enjoy reading (fiction and non-finction), exercising (regular gym goer, picking up running and
  bouldering), gaming (board and video games, obsessed with escape rooms), and TV Shows (random Netflix and Rupauls). I
  am happy you decided to come to DWH, see you there!
