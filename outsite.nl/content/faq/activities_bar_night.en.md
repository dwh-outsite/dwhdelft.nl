question: What can I expect when I visit the bar on a Thursday night?
---

When you visit our bar on a Thursday night, you can expect a warm and welcoming atmosphere where you can relax, make new friends, and often enjoy some fun activities. Our bar is run by volunteers who are always ready to chat and help you feel at home.

We typically have a variety of drinks available, including soft drinks, beer, and wine. Don't feel obligated to drink alcohol; we have plenty of non-alcoholic options as well.

Are you nervous about your first visit or coming alone? Check out our [barbuddy system](/barbuddy). A barbuddy is a member who can help you get to know the association and introduce you to other members. They will be there to answer any questions you might have and make sure you feel comfortable.
