question: Do I automatically join the KMG when I become a member?
---

No, you do not automatically join the [KMG](/kmg) when you become a member of Outsite. The KMG, or KennisMakingsGroep, is a special introductory group for new members who want to get to know Outsite and each other better. It is a unique opportunity to share experiences, learn about the LGBTI+ community, and build friendships in a supportive environment.

You can sign up for the KMG separately, even when you're not (yet) a member of Outsite. The KMG is open to all young people under the age of 29, regardless of their membership status. It is designed for those who want to connect with others, share their coming-out stories, and learn more about being LGBTI+ in a friendly and inclusive setting.
