question: Do I need to be a member to join the activities?
---

No, for most of our activities you do not need to be a member. Our weekly Thursday drinks are open to everyone, so feel free to join us and meet new people.

However, some of our activities are exclusive to members only. For example, our weekly dinners called EatingOUT. If you want to participate in these activities, you will need to [become a member](/#join-outsite).

A membership is a great way to support our association and get access to exclusive events, our association magazine, and more. If you have any questions about membership or our activities, feel free to reach out to us.
