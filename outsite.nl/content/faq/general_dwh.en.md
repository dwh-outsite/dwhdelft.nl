question: What is DWH?
---

Outsite is the "youth department" of DWH. DWH is an LGBTI+ association in Delft for all ages. The association was founded in 1968 and has since been a welcoming space for the LGBTI+ community in Delft. While it orginally started as a student activist group, it has grown into a diverse community that includes people of all ages and backgrounds.

DWH organizes a wide range of activities, including weekly drinks, parties, and education initiatives. DWH is also involved in advocacy and support for the LGBTI+ community in Delft and beyond. The organization is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

DWH is run by volunteers and is always looking for new members to join the community. Whether you are a student, a local resident, or just someone who wants to get involved, DWH welcomes you to become part of their vibrant and supportive community.
