question: Is everyone at your association queer?
---

The majority of our members identify as LGBTI+, but we welcome everyone who is under the age of 29, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We provide a safe and inclusive space for all young people, so even if you're not entirely sure yet, you are welcome to join us and explore your identity in a supportive environment.
