question: Can I join Outsite if I am not a student?
---

Yes, you can join Outsite even if you are not a student! Outsite is an LGBTI+ association that welcomes everyone under the age of 29, regardless of their student status. Since we are located in Delft, many of our members are students, but we also have a diverse community that includes local residents and young people from various backgrounds.
