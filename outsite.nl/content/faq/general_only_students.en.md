question: Can I join Outsite if I am not a student?
---

Yes, you can join Outsite even if you are not a student! Outsite is an LGBTI+ association that welcomes everyone between the ages of 16 and 29, regardless of your occupation. Since we are located in Delft, many of our members are students, but we also have a diverse community that includes local residents and young people from various backgrounds.
