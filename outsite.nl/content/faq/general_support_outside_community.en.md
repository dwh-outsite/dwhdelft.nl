question: I'm not LGBTI+ but I love your community, how can I support you?
---

Outsite is part of DWH, an LGBTI+ association in Delft, and we welcome everyone who supports our mission to create a safe and inclusive space for the LGBTI+ community. DWH is run by volunteers and is always looking for new members to join the community, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. While most of our members identify as LGBTI+, we also have allies and supporters who are not part of the community but want to help us achieve our goals. Check out the [DWH website](https://dwhdelft.nl/support-us) for more information on how to support us.
