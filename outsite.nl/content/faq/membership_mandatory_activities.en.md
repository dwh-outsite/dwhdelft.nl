question: Are there mandatory activities for new members?
---

No, there are no mandatory activities for new members. We understand that everyone has different schedules and commitments, so we do not require you to attend any specific events or activities.

We encourage you to participate in the activities that interest you, but there are no obligations. Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where you can engage with the community at your own pace.

At the start of an academic year, we do have a few activities that are specifically aimed at new members. These events are designed to help you get to know the association, meet other members, and learn more about what we do. However, attendance is entirely voluntary.
