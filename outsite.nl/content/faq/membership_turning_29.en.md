question: What happens to my Outsite membership when I turn 29?
---

You will remain a member of Outsite until the end of the board-year in which you turned 29.
The Outsite board year follows the academic calendar; it runs from 1 September until August 31st of the following year.
This means that you can come to Outsite bar nights and events with an age limit for the entire board year in which you turned 29.
For example, if you turned 29 in December 2025, you can still come until the board switches on 1 September 2026.
Your Outsite membership is also a DWH membership, so once you “age out” of Outsite, you’re still a member of DWH.

If you’re not a member, you can’t join age-restricted events once you’re 29.
