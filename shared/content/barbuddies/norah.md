  Hello there. My name is Norah and I'm in my early twenties. I currently study History at University of Leiden and
  live here in Delft. Oh, and of course, I've been a member at the fantastic association Outsite/DWH for over 2 years!
  Other than that I of course have a bunch of other happenings in my life. I mean I'm a big fan of reading,
  predominantly fantasy, and gaming (mainly Paradox games). Also arts and crafts are a beginning hobby of mine and I'm
  slowly putting together a whole room for it. But let’s not make this longer than it need be, just register for a
  barbuddy and come join our amazing association :D
  I'm usually there on mondays and thursdays so come get a bite with me at EatingOUT or a drink at the bar night.
