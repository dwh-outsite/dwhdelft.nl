  Heyy! I'm Wojtek and I'm a computer science student in my early twenties. I joined Outsite in 2022. I really enjoy
  the bar nights at DWH because social gatherings are my playground, and I feel really comfortable there. With me as
  your bar buddy you can expect introductions, friendly chats, and a genuine effort to make sure you're part of the
  fun. I would love to help you feel at ease attending our parties, whether you prefer dancing, or just sitting down
  and chatting over a drink. I am now a bartender too so hopefully you'll be seeing me behind the bar as well :)
