**This is a translated version of the Code of Conduct. The Dutch version is always leading.**

# 1. Do it together

Being a volunteer is something we do as a team. Support each other and help one another grow by sharing skills, but also by not asking too much of each other. Communicate about how things are going, especially when things aren't going well.

Stay open and see the positive in each other, even in conflict. Venting or talking things out helps. Gossip, personal attacks, or constantly seeking conflict don’t; and sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference. In those cases, bring in a third party.

# 2. Set a good example

As a volunteer, you quickly become a representative of DWH in the eyes of visitors. Take that responsibility seriously: in how you behave and what you project as the norm.

Make sure you represent the interests and viewpoints of the organization and comply with laws and rules. Maintain a positive attitude towards all parts of the organization and the volunteers working on them.

# 3. Positive and welcoming energy

We expect an open, positive, and welcoming attitude from you towards visitors, to help people feel welcome and make the activities enjoyable.

Some people have been with the organization longer, while others are newer, creating a constantly changing culture. Be mindful of these different experiences.

It requires energy, and sometimes you may not have it. If that's the case, let your fellow volunteers know and take a break.

# 4. Protect privacy

Visitors to DWH often need extra privacy. Give people the option not to be in photos, and don’t share stories without checking if it’s okay. For some, this can still be a matter of life and death.

# 5. Keep guidance and friendship separate

In some volunteer roles, you act as a guide for one or more participants; this creates a relationship of dependency, making it unequal. Therefore, it’s undesirable to combine this with a friendship, romantic, or sexual relationship.

Of course, we encourage people to form friendships after their role as a guide has ended. Make sure to clearly end your role as a guide, as this also protects you from an indefinite volunteer role. If feelings arise, inform your fellow volunteers and hand over your role as a guide as quickly as possible.

# 6. Clear responsibility

During an activity or urgent situation, there is no time to discuss who is responsible for what, so make sure this is clear beforehand. Don’t debate in the moment, follow the instructions of the person in charge, and discuss your ideas afterward if needed. The line of responsibility typically runs from the board to the coordinator/committee to the other volunteers.

# 7. Embrace diversity

We are a diverse community, but even among us, there are majorities and minorities. It can be easy to focus on the majority in promotional materials or when talking about the organization. Remember to think about those who don’t fall within that majority, both externally and within the organization itself.

It’s nice to resist the normative expectations and discrimination from the outside world. But make sure that doesn’t turn into making outright hurtful remarks about groups you’re not part of or don’t relate to.
