The _Alcoholwet_ requires all our bartenders to have a _Instructie Verantwoord Alcoholschenken (IVA)_ certificate.
To obtain this certificate, you have to complete an online course that teaches a lot about alcohol age limits, dealing with drunk guests, and avoiding unwanted situations.

### Three Steps
Complete the following three steps to obtain an IVA certificate:

* Follow [this online course](https://verantwoordalcoholverkopen.nl/studentenvereniging) (unfortunately, this course is only available in Dutch)
* Complete [the test](https://verantwoordalcoholverkopen.nl/toets). This requires you to create an account. While signing up select _Studentenvereniging_ as the _Branche_, and _Overig..._ as the _Studentenvereniging_
* When you have passed the test, please email your certificate to [barbeheer@dwhdelft.nl](mailto:barbeheer@dwhdelft.nl)
